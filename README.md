# react-testing-lab

In this lab, you will write a series of user-oriented front end tests to simulate different user interactions. While you've written unit tests before, this may be your first experience writing them for the *frontend*. While a little less intuitive, this type of testing can be very valuable for automating your otherwise manual tests. At the very least, it should give you some peace of mind to know that things you've already tested don't need to be tested again. Whenever you implement a new view or component, you can run the entire suite of tests and (assuming you wrote good test to begin with) should be able to see exactly which interactions are no longer working as expected. Most of the time, these tests won't break. But when they do, you'll be glad you wrote them!
